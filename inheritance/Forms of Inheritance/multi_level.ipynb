That means the derived/subclass class inherits the features of the base class/parent class, and the new derived class inherits the features of the derived class"

    "Imagine you have a family tree:\n",
    "\n",
    "Grandpa Joe is at the top (like the base class in programming).\n",
    "Dad Michael inherits things from Grandpa Joe, like eyes and a love for pancakes (inherits attributes and methods).\n",
    "You inherit things from Dad Michael, like your sense of humor and your sweet tooth (inherits from the inherited things).\n",
    "Multi-level inheritance in programming is like this family tree. One class inherits features from another class, which itself inherited features from another class, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Animal class: This is the \"Grandpa Joe\" of our program. It might have attributes like has_fur and can_move.\n",
    "Dog class: This inherits from Animal. It might add extra attributes like barks and wags_tail.\n",
    "Golden Retriever class: This inherits from Dog. It might add an attribute like loves_fetch.\n",
    "So, a Golden Retriever inherits everything from Animal (even though it wasn't directly connected). It's like getting Grandpa Joe's eyes and Dad Michael's sense of humor all in one package!\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-level inheritance can be really useful for organizing your code and avoiding repeating yourself. But it's important to use it carefully, because too many levels can make your program confusing and hard to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, you don't need a family tree of classes to have a great program! Use inheritance when it makes things simpler and clearer, but not just for the sake of having levels.\n",
