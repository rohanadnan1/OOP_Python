    "# Hierarchical Inheritance:\n",

    "## More easy explaination:\n",
    "Imagine a family tree:\n",
    "\n",
    "Parents and grandparents pass down traits to their children and grandchildren.\n",
    "This creates a hierarchy, where each generation builds upon the characteristics of the previous ones.\n",
    "Hierarchical inheritance in Python works similarly:\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes can inherit features from other classes, forming a \"family tree\" of related classes.\n",
    "This allows for code reusability and the creation of more specialized classes without repeating code.\n",
    "Here's a breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 Base Class:\n",
    "\n",
    "Like the \"grandparent\" in the family tree.\n",
    "Defines the basic characteristics and behaviors that will be shared by all its subclasses.\n",
    "Example: Animal class with attributes like has_fur and can_move.\n",
    "\n",
    "2 Subclasses:\n",
    "\n",
    "Like the \"children\" of the base class.\n",
    "Inherit features from the base class, but can also add their own unique attributes and methods.\n",
    "Example: Dog class inherits from Animal, adding barks and wags_tail.\n",
    "\n",
    "3 Multi-level Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Subclasses can inherit from other subclasses, creating a multi-level hierarchy.\n",
    "Example: GoldenRetriever inherits from Dog, adding loves_fetch.\n",
    "Key points:\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes inherit from each other using the class Subclass(BaseClass): syntax.\n",
    "Subclasses can access and use inherited attributes and methods directly.\n",
    "The super() function allows subclasses to call methods from their parent classes.\n",
    "Benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "Code reusability: Avoids repeating code across multiple classes.\n",
    "Specialization: Create more specific classes without losing shared functionality.\n",
    "Organization: Helps structure code in a logical and maintainable way.\n",
    "Remember:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use inheritance wisely to avoid overly complex class hierarchies.\n",
    "Design classes thoughtfully to create clear and meaningful relationships."
