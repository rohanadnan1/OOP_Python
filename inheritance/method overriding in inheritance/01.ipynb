    "# Super() Function in Python:\n",
    "The super() function in Python returns a proxy object that references the parent class using the super keyword. This super() keyword is basically useful in accessing the overridden methods of the parent class.\n",

    "\n",
    "Think of it like a special phone line to your parent class:\n",

    "Accessing Parent's Methods and Properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "When you want to use a method or property from the parent class within a child class, you use super() to make the call.\n",
    "It's like dialing up your parent class on a super phone to ask for help or borrow something they have.\n",

    "Building on Parent's Work:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use super() to extend or modify the behavior of a parent class without rewriting its code.\n",
    "It's like taking what your parent already did and adding your own personal touch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common Uses:\n",
    "\n",
    "Calling Parent's Constructor:\n",
    "\n",
    "When a child class has its own __init__() method (constructor), use super().__init__(...) to ensure the parent class's constructor is also called to properly initialize inherited attributes.\n",
    "It's like making sure your parent's setup is done before you do your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overriding Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to change how a method from the parent class works in the child class, use super().method_name() to call the original parent's version, potentially adding your own code before or after.\n",
    "It's like saying, \"Hey parent, I'm doing things a bit differently, but I still want to use some of your stuff.\""
