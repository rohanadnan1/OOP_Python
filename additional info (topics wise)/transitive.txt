Here's an explanation of "transitive" in programming, using easy-to-understand terms:

Imagine a chain of connections. In programming, "transitive" means something that flows or connects indirectly, through a chain of relationships.

Here are two common ways "transitive" is used in programming:

1. Transitive Dependencies:

Think of it like borrowing a book from a friend who borrowed it from the library.
In programming, a piece of code (A) might depend on another piece (B), which in turn depends on a third piece (C).
A doesn't directly use C, but it still needs C to function, because B relies on it.
This creates a transitive dependency: A depends on B, which depends on C. So, A indirectly depends on C.
2. Transitive Relations:

Imagine a game where you can beat a character who beat another character.
If you can beat someone who beat someone else, you're indirectly better than the third person.
In programming, transitive relations often involve comparisons like "greater than" or "equal to."
If A is greater than B, and B is greater than C, then transitivity means A is also greater than C.
Key points to remember:

Transitive relationships involve indirect connections.
They often create chains of dependencies or comparisons.
Being aware of transitive relationships helps manage code complexity and ensure code logic works as intended.
